## Welcome

New York City is a living organism, and the subway is its circulatory system. But what happens when that system is stressed?

This project explores how **Extreme Weather** (from heat waves to nor'easters) and **Mega-Events** (like the Marathon and Pride) alter the rhythm of the city. By analyzing over **2 million hourly ridership records** from 2024-2025, we uncover the hidden patterns of the daily commute.
