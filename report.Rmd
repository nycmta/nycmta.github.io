## Motivation

New York City runs on the subway. For millions of residents, it is the primary lifeline to work, education, and leisure. However, this lifeline is exposed to the elements. As climate change increases the frequency of extreme weather events—from blistering heat waves to flash floods—understanding the resilience of our transit system is critical.

Simultaneously, the city is a stage for global events. The NYC Marathon, Pride March, and other cultural phenomena transform the city's geography for a day. Understanding how these events pulse through the transit network helps in planning and crowd management.

**Our goal:** To quantify the "pulse" of the city by analyzing how **weather extremes** and **mega-events** distort the normal rhythms of subway ridership.

## Related Work

Our work builds on a rich tradition of urban analytics. Previous studies have looked at:

*   **Weather & Transit:** Studies in cities like Chicago and London have established that rain reduces discretionary travel, while extreme cold has a non-linear "chilling" effect on ridership.
*   **Event Impact:** Transport agencies often use "special event schedules," but granular, station-level impact analysis is often proprietary or retrospective.
*   **P8105 Precedents:** We drew inspiration from past projects like *Bikes in NYC* (Fall 2020), which successfully used spatial visualization to tell a story about transport usage.

## Initial Questions

We started with broad questions that evolved into specific "data stories":

1.  **Original Question:** How does weather affect ridership?
    *   *Evolved into:* Is there a "Goldilocks" temperature zone where ridership is maximized? How much does ridership drop during freezing cold vs. extreme heat?
2.  **Original Question:** Do events increase ridership?
    *   *Evolved into:* What is the "Blast Radius" of a mega-event? Do effects ripple across the borough, or are they hyper-localized?
3.  **Original Question:** Are all stations affected equally?
    *   *Evolved into:* Can we cluster stations by their "personality" (Commuter vs. Tourist) and determine which types are most "fair-weather" friends?

## Data

We synthesized data from four disparate sources to build a comprehensive **Station-Hour** and **Station-Day** panel for 2024-2025.

*   **MTA Subway Hourly Ridership:** The backbone of our analysis. We processed over **1.9 million** hourly records for 123 Manhattan stations.
    *   *Challenge:* The raw data is massive (disaggregated by fare type).
    *   *Solution:* We used Socrata API's SoQL query language to perform server-side aggregation (`SUM(ridership)`) before downloading, reducing data volume by 96%.
*   **NOAA Weather Data (Central Park):** Daily temperature (`TMAX`), precipitation (`PRCP`), and snowfall (`SNOW`) from the Global Historical Climatology Network (GHCN).
*   **NYC Permitted Events:** A database of 150,000+ permits. We filtered for "Major" events (parades, street closures) to isolate true disruptors.
*   **Geospatial Data:** Station coordinates allowed us to map the "Blast Radius" of events and visualize spatial patterns.

## Analysis

Our initial exploration revealed strong temporal patterns.

*   **Weekly Rhythm:** The classic "two-humped" camel shape of AM/PM peaks on weekdays contrasts sharply with the broad, single midday peak of weekends.
*   **Seasonality:** Ridership shows a dip in deep winter (Jan/Feb) and stability through the summer, debunking the idea that New Yorkers abandon the subway in July.

We moved beyond simple correlations to four targeted analyses (detailed on the [Analysis](model.html) page).

### Story 1: The Goldilocks Zone
Using a **Generalized Additive Model (GAM)**, we found that the relationship between weather and ridership is **non-linear**, with temperature and precipitation interacting to shape commuter behavior.

*   **The "Comfort Zone":** Ridership peaks between **60°F and 75°F** on dry days.
*   **Rain Sensitivity:** Precipitation has a stronger marginal effect than temperature—a half-inch of rain causes more ridership loss than a 20°F temperature swing.
*   **The Worst Conditions:** Cold + wet days see the steepest drops (20-35% below average), while hot dry days show only modest declines. New Yorkers will sweat, but they won't freeze.

### Story 2: The Event Blast Radius
We mapped the station-level percent change in ridership during the **NYC Marathon** and **Pride March**.

*   **Marathon:** Created a linear "corridor of activity" along the Upper West Side and 1st Avenue.
*   **Pride:** Showed an intense, concentrated "hotspot" in the West Village, with some stations seeing surges of >50% above baseline.
*   This confirms that "Citywide" events are often geographically specific phenomena.

### Story 3: Station Personalities
We used **K-Means Clustering** on hourly ridership profiles to classify stations by commute flow direction.

*   **Residential Stations:** Sharp morning peaks as commuters leave their neighborhoods.
*   **Commercial Stations:** Evening peaks as workers leave offices to head home.
*   **Geographic Pattern:** Commercial stations cluster in Midtown and the Financial District, while Residential stations dominate the Upper West Side and Upper East Side. Transit hubs like Penn Station and Times Square show Residential patterns despite their Midtown location.

### Story 4: Rain Sensitivity by Hour
We analyzed how rain sensitivity varies throughout the day.

*   **Morning Rush Most Sensitive:** Ridership drops 20-30% during 7-9 AM on rainy days—commuters switch to alternatives due to strict arrival deadlines.
*   **Evening More Resilient:** Afternoon/evening shows smaller drops (5-18%) because travelers can wait for rain to stop.
*   **MTA Implication:** Service adjustments should focus on morning rush demand reductions on rainy days.

## Discussion

Our findings paint a picture of a transit system that is deeply intertwined with the physical and social environment of the city.

*   **Resilience:** The system is remarkably resilient to heat but vulnerable to cold.
*   **Temporal Patterns:** Morning commuters are most sensitive to rain due to strict work deadlines, while evening travelers can wait for weather to clear.
*   **Station Identity:** The Residential/Commercial classification reveals how Manhattan's geography shapes commute flows—workers flow inward in the morning and outward in the evening.
*   **Event Planning:** The "Blast Radius" maps could help the MTA target service increases more precisely—sending extra trains not just "to Manhattan" but specifically to the 1/2/3 lines during the Marathon or the A/C/E during Pride.

**Limitations:**

*   **Manhattan Focus:** We limited our scope to Manhattan. The outer boroughs likely show different "Commuter" dynamics.
*   **Events Data:** "Permitted Events" is a noisy dataset. We had to manually curate major events to filter out block parties.
